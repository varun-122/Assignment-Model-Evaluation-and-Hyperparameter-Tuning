Trained multiple machine learning models and evaluated their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Implemented hyperparameter tuning techniques like GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters. Analyzed the results to select the best-performing model.
